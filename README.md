This is a simple C programming lngugae library to use the DAC of LPC1768 by NXP based on the ARM Cortex M3 architecture.
It implements the basic operations to be carried out as a digital input is converted to an analog voltage.

The header file dac.h can be inlcuded to an application program file and the functions cann be called as regular C functions.
Both dac.h and dac.c must be copied to the project folder.

This library is developed and tested on Keil Micro-Vision 4 using a Keil 17xx evaluation board.
